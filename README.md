## **Oveview**: 

Create a Kickstarter / Go Fundme clone for the Bar and Nightlife industry. The web app would be a promotional tool to promote and pre-sell events and provide value to customers. (_During the covid19 pandemic bars and bartenders have turned to gofundme to raise money to cover losses because they have not been able to open their doors. PartyFundME would be catered specifically for bars/nightclubs to raise money but provide a platform for the bar or person throwing event to offer some value return i.e. open bars, private partys, band, dj, etc._ ) 

>I had a startup a few years ago called MoneyShot. The concept was to send drinks back and forth to friends on their birthdays. (If it was my buddy Emmet's birthday and he is in NYC and I knew his favorite bar, I wanted to send him a drink or pay for his bar tab for his birthday. The app had a hard time gaining traction due to lack of participating bars.

> 
 
MoneyShot never gained traction, but I did have  success  “crowdfunding” parties. I would throw parties for friends' birthdays at popular bars in SF.  
>1.I would create a flyer for the party.   
>2.Post on social media circle, inviting everyone to the party but if they coudn't make it could buy a round.  
>3.Used money that was "chipped in" / donated to create a tab at the bar.  

Moneyshot would average 1000$ raised a party. The bar owners and staff were happy, party goers were happy, and most of all >the person we threw the parties for were happy.
